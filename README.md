# yahtzee
just a yahtzee game made for a CS final project (champlain st lambert). Quite messy really, I'll eventually clean up any errors.
Feel free to test it and ask for a pull request. This was my first attempt at a game using Java, so it's not entirely perfect. Made exclusively using Java and JavaFX.

If you want to use as a reference, please credit, I invested a lot of time into this project.


made by Grayson Yen, Noah Dohnani, and Giuseppe Caruana

Known Bugs:
- When returning from play menu, and opening new menu, the buttons to choose a combo don't work properly (same with probabilities).
- Hand stays the same for turn 1when after choosing a combo.

  To set up file:
  - create a new folder in "main" and name it resources.
  - in src/main, have two files "java" and "Resources"
  - each have a folder inside them that matches the project name, here it is: "YahtzeeProject"
  - "java" contains all the controllers and the classes
  - "Resources" contains all the FXML files
  - run the code in Main.java
